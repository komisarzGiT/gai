If we wanted we could then proceed to write a Python implementation.\n",

    "If you've spent much time in Java or similar object-oriented language, you've probably typed `int getX() { return X; }` and `void setX(int X) { this.X = X; }` a million times. In Python there's no need for that: all fields (variables belonging to an object) are public, so given an object `c`, you can get a variable's value by saying `c.X` or set it by saying `c.X = 17` as appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in Java, sometimes it's useful to enforce some bounds checking, or validity checking, or to carry out some calculations or book-keeping whenever a caller `get`s or `set`s a field. We can do that in Python too, of course. But the nice thing is we can start off by making a class using the direct access to fields, as above, and later on change to access mediated by `get` and `set` methods, without changing any of the code that *uses* the class. We use a mechanism called `@property`, which is outside the scope of this module, but which you can look up [here](http://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php). "

    "\n",
    "This question arises because it's often possible to write all your code as just one line after another, without defining and using any functions. But it's not a good idea. The point of a function is to work as a machine that does a single job well, so that people can then use it to get that job done, without having to think about how it's done. Here, \"people\" might mean yourself. If your programming task is large and complex, you can manage that complexity by dividing the problem up into smaller sub-tasks (and sub-sub-tasks, etc) until one of them is small enough to be implemented as a single function. And then your mind doesn't have to worry about *how* that function works anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of creating functions to do jobs, and then just using them and forgetting how they work internally (in order to cut complexity) is called *abstraction* and it is crucial in all types of programming.

    "* `IndexError`: you tried to access, for example, element 13 of a 4-item list.\n",
    "* `TypeError`: can mean a few things, but for example if you try to modify a string or tuple you get this error. Remember they are immutable. You can make a new string or tuple with the desired new contents instead. For strings you can also use `replace` or a few other modifiers if appropriate. `TypeError` also occurs if you pass too many or too few arguments to a function: `math.sin(45, 90)`.\n",
    "* `NameError`: you tried to use a variable, function, or class that didn't exist. Maybe you mis-spelled it, or forgot to `import` something?\n",
