    "When dealing with large data, Python can be slow. If we have a list of 10 numbers and we calculate the mean, it is instantaneous. But if we have 10 million numbers, it will be slow. The reason for this is Python's *flexibility*. Python allows a list to contain any type of value, eg we can have a mixed list of `int`s, `float`s, `string`s, other `list`s, and so on. Python has to check what type each value is before deciding how to add it (or whether it even *can* add it). \n",
